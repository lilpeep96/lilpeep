<h4 style="color: #FFFFFF"><strong><u>Lil Peep's Early Life</u></strong></h4>
<p style="color: #FFFFFF">Gustav Elijah Åhr was born on November 1, 1996, in Allentown, Pennsylvania to first-grade teacher Liza Womack and college professor Karl Johan Åhr. He had one sibling, Karl "Oskar" Åhr. Åhr grew up on Long Island, New York. His parents were both Harvard graduates who divorced when he was a teenager. Åhr was of Irish descent on his mother's side and Swedish and German descent on his father's side. He claimed to have Swedish citizenship on Twitter. 
Growing up, Åhr's father was absent and his upbringing was "apathetic and drug-fuelled" with his father and mother divorcing formally when Åhr was 14. He attended Lindell Elementary School and then Long Beach High School in Lido Beach, New York, which he rarely attended in spite of good grades and was on the deans list for the time he attended. He later dropped out of the high school and took online courses to earn his diploma. Shortly thereafter, he began posting his music on YouTube and SoundCloud.
When Åhr was 17, he got his first face tattoo, a broken-heart below his left eye to help motivate him to make music before he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in music, under the pseudonym Lil Peep. Åhr stated that his reason for moving out to Los Angeles was due to feeling depressed living on Long Island</p>


<h4 style="color: #FFFFFF"><strong><u>Lil Peep's Career</u></strong></h4>
<p style="color: #FFFFFF">When Lil Peep was a teenager, he called himself a loner who made a majority of his friends online. Inspired by underground acts like Seshhollowaterboyz and iLoveMakonnen. Peep was making music whilst residing in Long Island under the pseudonym "Trap Goose" and lived temporarily with childhood friend Brennan Savage until both decided to move to Los Angeles. 
Lil Peep left high school early to move to Los Angeles and meet up with online friends. Initially living in Skid Row, Los Angeles and dipping in and out of homelessness, staying in Brennan Savage's apartment whilst Savage pursued a degree, the two went separate ways and Peep eventually met up with Atlanta rapper and producer JGRXXN and Florida rappers Ghostemane and Craig Xen, living with them while forming the collective Schemaposse. According to Lil Peep, he originally met Craig Xen online and was introduced to JGRXXN who needed a singer. Lil Peep also attempted to attend Glendale Community College during his first year living in Los Angeles. In 2015, Lil Peep released his first mixtape, Lil Peep Part One, which generated 4,000 plays in its first week. Shortly thereafter, he released his first extended play, Feelz, and another mixtape, Live Forever. Lil Peep began to grow in popularity soon after, with the song "Star Shopping" (later released as a single following his death) from Lil Peep Part One making waves in underground hip-hop circles. Lil Peep's popularity continued to grow after the release of the song "Beamer Boy" which led to him performing live for the first time with the rest of Schemaposse in March 2016 in Tucson, Arizona. The following month, Schemaposse broke up and Lil Peep was not associated with any collective though they remained on good terms. Shortly after the breakup of Schemaposse, Peep remained living in Skid Row, Los Angeles though he had begun to associate with Los Angeles-based rap collective, Gothboiclique, featuring members of the group on his full-length mixtape Crybaby. The group shared a squat in Skid Row with Peep and often shared beds. According to Lil Peep, Crybaby was recorded within the space of three days with a $150 microphone. He did a majority of the mixing and mastering himself. Crybaby was released in June 2016. 
In June 2016, First Access Entertainment (FAE) partnered with Lil Peep on a joint venture to invest in and advise him on his career. 
In addition to providing business guidance, co-founder/CEO, Sarah Stennett, was also a friend who gave both moral and financial support - helping Peep realize his vision. In September 2016, Lil Peep released Hellboy. Songs from Hellboy such as "Girls" and "OMFG" began to clock in millions of views and plays on SoundCloud and YouTube. The success from Hellboy led to Peep going on his first-ever solo tour across the United States, called "The Peep Show" tour, starting in April 2017 and ending in May 2017. In May 2017, the band Mineral accused Peep of copyright infringement for including an unlicensed and uncredited sample of their song "LoveLetterTypewriter" in his "Hollywood Dreaming" track. Peep said that he was only trying to "show some love" with the sample. 
Soon after the tour was done, Peep immigrated to London, England during a disentanglement with his collective Gothboiclique. In London, Peep began to associate with a new set of people encompassing of figures such as Atlanta rapper iLoveMakonnen and long-term friend Bexey (fka Bexey Swan.) Whilst living in London, Peep recorded Come Over When You're Sober Pt, 1 and Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 2, an EP entitled Goth Angel Sinner and an untitled project with iLoveMakonnen. Peep released his debut studio album Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 1 on August 15, 2017. Lil Peep also announced and took part in his first World tour, starting in the UK in September and moving to Germany before finishing in the United States in November which was cut short due to his untimely death.</p>
